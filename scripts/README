scripts: 

1. changeMinimumTextSize.pl
	Small perl script to - surprise! - change the minimum size of the 
	text elements on a board. 
	*YOU MUST EDIT THIS FILE TO SET THE MINIMUM SIZE*
	usage: 
	./changeMinimumTextSize.pl in.brd out.brd
	(do not use the same file name for both - 
	copy the file back once you are satisfied with the result.)
	
2. hideAllValueTexts.pl
	Another small script to hide the value (e.g. "1.2K", "2.2uf" etc.)
	texts on a board. 
	usage: 
	./hideAllValueTexts.pl in.brd out.brd
	(do not use the same file name for both - 
	copy the file back once you are satisfied with the result.)
	
3. digikeyweborder
	This reads in a CSV file, establishes a TCP connection with the Digikey
	ordering web server, and repeatedly POSTs the quantities in your 
	spreadsheet onto the active server pages.  If the minimum quantities
	are not met for any of your items, it will first guess the next multiple of
	10, and if that does not work, it will ask you for the quantity.  Digikey's
	webserver occasionally balks under the torrent of POST and GETs, in 
	which case you'll have to kill the script, start a new web order, 
	and try again.  
	
	To compile, you'll need to: 
	# apt-get install ocaml libpcre-ocaml-dev ocaml-findlib libocamlnet-ocaml-dev
	then 'make'
	
	then run, e.g.: 
	./digikeyweborder bom_digikey.csv 2 5 16973993 41138
	
	where: 
	bom_digikey.csv is exported from your BOM spreadsheet,
		and has digikey part numbers in one column, 
		and quantities in another. 
	2 is the column, zero-indexed, of the part number
	5 is the colum, zero-indexed, of the quantities
	16973993 is the WebID 
	41138 is the AccessID
	You can obtain the WebID and AccessID through http://ordering.digikey.com/

	No guarantees are made of this program's functionality :-)
