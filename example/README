This is a digitally current-regulated microstimulator that I designed 
for my research.  Two layer PCB, relatively large vias, nothing too 
complciated. 

When opening microstim8_3.brd in kicadocaml, the program will ask
you for the associated schematic - here it is microstim8.sch.
microstim.sch is dupliacted 8 times to generate each of the 8 channels
(via the array feature :-)
